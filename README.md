# 4 | vertical Image Thumbnail List

###### The Fourth Project on this web development journey of mine. 

The focus of this project was more on the concept as opposed to the design (although that was not neglected). The idea of a Vertical Image list was inspired by a design that I had come across and really caught my eye. I simply wished to make the concept a reality, to code it up myself, yet I was unable to find any real premade examples of which I could draw inspiration upon. Thus, this is my own 'unique' implementation, though it is actually quite simple.
